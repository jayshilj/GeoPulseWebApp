🌏 GeoPulse | Strategic Intelligence Dashboard
GeoPulse is an AI-powered open-source intelligence (OSINT) tool that analyzes geopolitical relations between nations in real-time.

Built with Python and Streamlit, it leverages the Perplexity API (Sonar-Pro) to synthesize diplomatic reports, economic data, and news headlines into a structured, visual dashboard. It provides quantitative tension scores (0-100), historical comparisons (Year-over-Year), and trade deficit estimates.

🚀 Features
1. 📡 Regional Monitor (Live Dashboard)
Tension Gauge (0-100): Visualizes the current diplomatic pressure between two entities.

🟢 0-20: Strategic Alliance

🔴 81-100: Active Conflict

Year-Over-Year (YoY) Comparison: Calculates the delta between today's tension score and the score from exactly one year ago.

Trade Deficit Estimator: Provides an approximate trade deficit figure (in Billions USD) even when exact data is scarce, using AI estimation based on economic reports.

Intelligence Feed: Fetches the latest relevant news headlines with sources and dates.

2. 📊 Global Heatmap
Top 10 Rankings: Generates dynamic lists of the highest tension zones (Flashpoints) and the most stable alliances globally.

Auto-Refresh: Caches data to save API credits but allows for manual refreshing.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit (Web UI)

Visualization: Plotly (Interactive Gauges)

AI / LLM: Perplexity API (Model: sonar-pro)

Data Processing: Pandas & JSON

This tool is for informational purposes only. The data is generated by an Artificial Intelligence (LLM) which researches the internet in real-time. While usually accurate, AI can occasionally hallucinate figures or misinterpret nuanced diplomatic events. Always verify critical data with official government sources (e.g., World Bank, Ministry of External Affairs).
